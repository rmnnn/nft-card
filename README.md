## My process

- I launched design files and introduced myself into the whole concept
- After I introduced myself, I started with plain HTML
- Just after HTML data I started with CSS and finished work there

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I made good experience while working on this project. It just gives you some space to think about how to set up all things and makes your creativity better.

### Useful resources
